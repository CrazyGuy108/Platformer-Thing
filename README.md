# Platformer-Thing
A prototype for a platformer made using Godot.

## Controls
* Left/Right arrows: Move the player.
* Space: Jump.

## Things I learned
* First time using cutout animation to minimize the amount of sprites I would have to draw.
* A lot about the physics engine and how to properly use it so the player doesn't get stuck on the tilemap.
* How to apply the State Pattern to make the player script more extendable.
* Sound design using sfxr.
